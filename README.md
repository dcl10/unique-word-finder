# unique-word-finder

Attempts to find five 5-letter words with 25 unique letters between them.

Sample data from https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/sgb-words.txt

Inspiration for the challenger from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-AfhLQfb6w&t=0s&ab_channel=Stand-upMaths

At the moment I can only find sets of 3 five-letter words with unique letters. I don't know if this is the word list or my algorithm. Pull requests with suggestions welcome!
